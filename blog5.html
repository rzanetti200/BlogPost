      <h2>Week 2 Blog:</h2>
      <p>
        I read an article which describes 10 important html tags that every one
        should know. After reading this article I have a better understanding of
        how to write code more efficently. One important tag that anyone working
        with html should know is the &ltcite&gt, this tag allows the user to
        define text inside of the element as a reference. This tag works like
        the &ltblackquote&gt element, except that it will also make the word
        italic this can be easily changed using some simple css if needed. The
        &ltcite&gt, tag is useful for citing bibliographic and other cite
        refrences.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also found the &ltaddress&gt tag can also be useful, in allowing you
        to semantically markup addresses in HTML. It also allows the user to
        italicize all the data that is given to it. As i've written more code in
        html i've found that it's difficult to always know what revisions you
        have made in your code this is where tags like &ltins&gt and &ltdel&gt
        come in. These tags will cross out anything in the &ltdel&gt brackets
        and &ltins&gt on the other hand will show the user to user the revision
        made by underlining the word inside the &ltins&gt brackets.
      </p>
      <p>Here is an example of how these tags can be used:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>
          Example 1: <cite>The Scream</cite> by Edward Munch. Painted in 1893.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the example above the words "Scream" is wrapped inside of the
          &ltcite&gt tag.
        </p>

        <p>Example 2: Harris <del>Likes</del> <ins>Loves</ins> coding</p>
        <p>
          In the example above the words "Likes" is wrapped inside of the
          &ltdel&gt tag and the word "Loves" is wrapped inside the &ltins&gt
          tag.
