            <p>I learned how to make a css animation. 
                I can specify how long the animation lasts, 
                how many repetitions there are, 
                and how the animation transitions without javascript by using a number of css elements.</p>
            <div id="anim-block">animation!</div>
            <code>
                <pre>
@keyframes fade-anim {
    from {background-color: red;}
    to {background-color: black;}
}

#anim-block {
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    animation-name: fade-anim;
    animation-duration: 3s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-direction: alternate;
}
                </pre>
            </code>

            <p>I also learned how to make a gradient color. This allows for some
            cool color effects. to be able to customize the colors i feature on my website in this way, it will help  my website feel more personal and professionl </p>

            <div id="gradient-block1">gradient!</div>
            <br />
            <div id="gradient-block2">gradient!</div>

            <br /><br />This week, I also learned about another interesting HTML element: the
      &lt;details&gt; tag. <br />
      It appears to be a very handy tag for when a developer has a lot of information that can be expanded on but would take up too much space otherwise.
For example, rather than presenting all of the information on all of the different breeds of cats at once, I could hide it until a user wishes to see a single cat's information. <br />
There are numerous additional applications for this, such as different sorts of cars or anything with a lot of distinct types of information. <br />
      <br />
      Here is an example
      <ax
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details"
        target="_blank"
        >HERE</a
      >
      about the &lt;details&gt; tag.
