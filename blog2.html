      <h1>Typing Animation</h1>
      <p>
        I was interested in how I could make my website look better and more
        profesional this week. I ended up stumbling across some cool CSS
        animations. <br />
        There are a lot of really cool looking animations, but the one that
        stuck out to me was one that simulated typing. <br />
        This is a really easy and simple animation that looks really good when
        used. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/typewriter-effect/">Source for how I learned it</a> <br /> 
        <br />
        Here is an example of what it looks like:

      <h1>HTML Coding Shortcuts</h1>
      <p>I tried to learn some shortcuts that would help me speed up my coding. The first trick I learned was that I could just type out the element without its tags and VSCode would do the rest for me. 
        For example I could type in "p" or "div" and VSCode would auto complete it to &lt;p&gt; &lt;p/&gt; or &lt;div&gt; &lt;div/&gt;. <br>
         Another example of a shortcut is the ability to type an element followed by a . and then you can type out anything, and that will become the name of the class for that element.         
         <br> An example of this would look like div.classname which would turn into &lt;div class="classname"&gt; &lt;div/&gt; <br> The final trick I learned was adding a * followed by a number before declarding an element and it will create the number amount of elements.
         <br> This would look like div*5, and would create this: <br>
         <br>&lt;div&gt; &lt;div/&gt;<br>&lt;div&gt; &lt;div/&gt;<br>&lt;div&gt; &lt;div/&gt;<br>&lt;div&gt; &lt;div/&gt;<br>&lt;div&gt; &lt;div/&gt;<br>
