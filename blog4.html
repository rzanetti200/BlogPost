            <p>I learned how to create text tooltips. This would be useful for acronyms or words that my readership might not understand. All you have to do is give the stretched text a title property. <span title="This is a tooltip!">Hover over me!</span></p>
            <code>
                <pre>
&lt;span&gt;title="This is a tooltip!">Hover over me!&lt;/span&gt;
                </pre>
            </code>

            <p>Variables can also be stored in vanilla CSS. You can assign a CSS value to a variable with the var() method. this is helpfull if you dont want to have to keep refereing to a specific value each and every time you code in css.</p>

            <code>
                <pre>
:root {
    --big-size: 100px;
}

.var {
    font-size: var(--big-size);
}

&lt;p&gt;I will make this &lt;span class="var"&gt;word&lt;/span&gt; very big!&lt;/p&gt;
                </pre>
            </code>

<p>I will make this <span class="var">word</span> very big!</p>

<p>I attempted to learn some coding shortcuts that would allow me to code more quickly. The first technique I discovered was that I could simply type the element without its tags and VSCode will take care of the rest.
    For example, if I type "p" or "div," VSCode will autocomplete it with "p" or "div." &lt;p&gt; &lt;p/&gt; or &lt;div&gt; &lt;div/&gt;. <br>
     Another example of a shortcut is the ability to type an element followed by a . and then you can type out anything, and that will become the name of the class for that element.         
     <br> An example of this would look like div.classname which would turn into &lt;div class="classname"&gt; &lt;div/&gt; <br> The final trick I learned was adding a * followed by a number before declarding an element and it will create the number amount of elements.
     <br> This would look like div*5, and would create this: <br>
     <br>&lt;div&gt; &lt;div/&gt;<br>&lt;div&gt; &lt;div/&gt;<br>&lt;div&gt; &lt;div/&gt;<br>&lt;div&gt; &lt;div/&gt;<br>&lt;div&gt; &lt;div/&gt;<br>
