<p><a id="BlogPost 1"></a>This week, I learned different ways of structuring my website to best convey its contents. I learned how to employ various html entities, how to use different fonts and colors on my text, and how to import photos and gifs. 

    <br>I also learned how to validate if my code is correct in its syntax and layout. This will be helpful later down the line and prevent avoidable time wasting mistakes. Overall, these lessons will help make my website more captivating to the viewer.
