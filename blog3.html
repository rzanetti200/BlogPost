            <p>I learned how to make a css animation. 
                I can specify how long the animation lasts, 
                how many repetitions there are, 
                and how the animation transitions without javascript by using a number of css elements.</p>
            <div id="anim-block">animation!</div>
            <code>
                <pre>
@keyframes fade-anim {
    from {background-color: red;}
    to {background-color: black;}
}

#anim-block {
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    animation-name: fade-anim;
    animation-duration: 3s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
    animation-direction: alternate;
}
                </pre>
            </code>

            <p>I also learned how to make a gradient color. This allows for some
            cool color effects. to be able to customize the colors i feature on my website in this way, it will help  my website feel more personal and professionl </p>

            <div id="gradient-block1">gradient!</div>
            <br />
            <div id="gradient-block2">gradient!</div>

            <br /><br />Another interesting HTML element I learned this week is the
      &lt;details&gt; tag. <br />
      It seems like it would be a very useful tag for when a developer has a lot
      of topics of information that can be expanded on, but would otherwise take
      up too much room.
      For example, if I had a bunch of different breeds of cats with information
      about each one rather than have all of it presented at once I could hide
      it until a user wants to open a specific cats information. <br />
      There are many other examples of how this could be applied, such as types
      of cars, or really anything that have a lot of different types and
      information. <br />
      <br />
      Here is an example of how this could be done. More information can be
      found
