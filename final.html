<h1>How would i teach this course</h1>

<p>Once students have mastered the basics of working with the software, the course generates discussion of usability, 
    color, layout, fonts, negative space, image quality and placement and so much more, all without involving code. It enables students to picture a Web page 
    in their minds without being too concerned about how the page would be coded. When the student does start coding the page, they will have the skills to 
    clarify what they want to build before writing a line of code.
