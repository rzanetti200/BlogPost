    <p>the goal this week was to learn how to make my website more aestetic and user 
        oriented. Something i stumbled across this week got me excited. i learned how to
        change the color of links when someone hoveres over them or clicks on them. This helps
        the user know that the link is clickable and makes my website seem more custom and professional.

    <h1> here is some sample code demonstrating how this would happen</h1>

    <pre>
        <style type="text/css">
            A:link { COLOR: black; TEXT-DECORATION: none; font-weight: normal }
            A:visited { COLOR: black; TEXT-DECORATION: none; font-weight: normal }
            A:active { COLOR: black; TEXT-DECORATION: none }
            A:hover { COLOR: blue; TEXT-DECORATION: none; font-weight: none }
            </style>
    </pre>
