      <h2>Week 2 Blog:</h2>
      <p>
        I just saw an article that outlined ten essential HTML tags that everyone should be familiar with. 
        I now have a better knowledge of how to create code more effectively as a result of reading this post. 
        Anyone dealing with HTML should be familiar with the &ltcite&gt tag, which allows the user to designate text inside the element as a reference. 
        This tag functions similarly to the &ltblackquote&gt element, with the exception that it also makes the word italic. 
        This can be readily altered with some simple CSS if necessary. The tag &ltcite&gt is used for quoting bibliographic and other referenced sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        I discovered that the &ltaddress&gt tag can also be useful for semantically marking up addresses in HTML. 
        It also allows the user to italicize all of the information provided to it. 
        As I've written more html code, I've discovered that it's tough to keep track of the changes you've made to your code. 
        This is where tags like &ltins&gt and &ltdel&gt come in handy. 
        These tags will cross out anything inside the &ltdel&gt brackets, while &ltins&gt will highlight the word inside the &ltins&gt brackets to show the user the revision made.
      </p>
      <p>Here is an example of how these tags can be used:</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>
          Example 1: <cite>The Scream</cite> by Edward Munch. Painted in 1893.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the example above the words "Scream" is wrapped inside of the
          &ltcite&gt tag.
        </p>

        <p>Example 2: Robbie <del>Loves</del> <ins>Loves</ins> Web Delelopment</p>
        <p>
          In the example above the words "Likes" is wrapped inside of the
          &ltdel&gt tag and the word "Loves" is wrapped inside the &ltins&gt
          tag.
